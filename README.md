# Embeded-Control
On completion of this course, the student will: 
(1) Be able to design interface hardware and software to sense, display, command, and control simple engineering processes. 
(2) Be able to write
    software for a real-time embedded control system. 
(3) *Be able to prototype, implement, and debug the hardware for an embedded control system. 
(4) Understand the basic operation of microcontrollers and their role
    in embedded control systems. 
(5) Understand the role of sensors and actuators and how they are applied to
    systems. 
(6) *Understand and be able to use the laboratory voltmeters and logic probes required to build and troubleshoot these systems.
    Instruction of the items marked with a * will be achieved through instructor provided tasks consisting of
    in-class “experiments” and video based homework assignments.
